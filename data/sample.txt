# Introduction to FastAPI

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.

## Key Features

- **Fast**: Very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic).
- **Fast to code**: Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%.
- **Fewer bugs**: Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors.
- **Intuitive**: Great editor support. Completion everywhere. Less time debugging.
- **Easy**: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.
- **Short**: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration.
- **Robust**: Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation.
- **Standards-based**: Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards for APIs: OpenAPI and JSON Schema.

FastAPI stands on the shoulders of giants: Starlette for the web parts and Pydantic for the data parts.

## Example Usage

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}

@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
def read_item(item_id: int, q: str = None):
    return {"item_id": item_id, "q": q}
```

This simple application provides two routes with automatic data validation, serialization, and interactive documentation.
