Implement a test script to check our service using curl.

Example request:

(base) Mac ~/projects/lfnt % curl http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer no-key" \
-d '{
"key": "py_excp",
"request" : {
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Write a joke"
        }
    ]}
}'

We need to test it with longer message. To do that, create a script which would run curl like above, the content should be:

'Please briefly summarize the following file: <content of data/sample.txt>'

Create a small sample.txt file first, I'll create a larger file for testing myself.
