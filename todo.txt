Implement a wrapper over http server which would handle session management and persistence.

The interface for existing server S is a POST request to endpoint v1/chat/completions

The only HTTP header is content-type == json.
The data is some json payload.

Our service should receive the extended request:

data = {
    "key": "some_string_key",
    "request" : request_we_need_to_pass_to_original
}

Before sending the request to S, we need to do the following:

1. Call S on /slots/0?action=restore endpoint with the following json payload:

{
    "filename": f"{data.key}.bin"
}

2. Call the S' main endpoint with data.request

3. Return the response to client

4. After that, call /slots/0?action=save endpoint with same 

{
    "filename": f"{data.key}.bin"
}
