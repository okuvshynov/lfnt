Implement yet another microservice.

It should receive 2 arguments:
1. Path to git repository
2. Text query

It needs to:
1. Collect detailed log of the repo, similar to what you'd get by running 'git show <>', for last N commits. Include full hash, short hash (8 symbols) and the content.
2. Create a message like 'You are given last N commits and a request at the end. Return the most relevant commit ids for engineer to sudy to better understand the codebase and request. <commits> <original_query>'
3. Send http post request to current Session Management Service. check test_service to see the format for the request. Use last component of repo path + '_git_history' as session key. For example, if the git repo path was /home/alice/projects/foobar, use foobar_git_history as session key.
